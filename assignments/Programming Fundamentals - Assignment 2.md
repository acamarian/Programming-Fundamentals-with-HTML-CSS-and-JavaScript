## Self Check

This following questions are for self check, you do not have to turn them in. But seriously ask your self these questions and see if you can answer them. if you can answer them, that is a sign that you have mastery on the last session's topics otherwise that is a sign that you have to go back and review the materials.

1. What is an attribute, can you identify 7 attributes from the profile page we created during the last lectures
2. what do we use the `div` element for?
3. why we should not always rely on element selectors?
4. what are selectors, properties, values, declaration/s and rules? 
5. how do we make our HTML file talk to our CSS file
6. can you quickly do the following:
   1. create  a new project , 
   2. create the sub folders, styles, scripts and images
   3. add any image/s to the images folder
   4. open it in visual studio code, 
   5. create the HTML and CSS files in their respective folders. 
   6. add some elements (headings, paragraphs, image and a link) with attributes (eg a class or two)
   7. use blocks or so
   8. link your HTML and CSS file
   9. add some style and see how it looks in the browser (use class selector)

**Note**: If you can do number 6, **thumbs up** and know that you have really up your game and you will be a great developer in the future God willing. otherwise do not worry, you still have to put more effort and practice and you should be okay. (Take your time).
