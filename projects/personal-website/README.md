# Ayda Badjie Personal Website
Ayda badjie website is a fake website created for the students to learn how to create the followings:

- How to structure page layout using the generic containers for styling and semantics
- How create hyperlinks using different kinds of links
- 

The website is created to use a minimalist color, shape, and typography to express simplisity in design

## Website architecture 
Ayda's website information architecture has a hierarchical structure, allowing users to look at who Ayda is, what she does and where is she coming from. The hero section on above the fold shows these and a call to action to work with her.

### Content
Content is divided into pages related to portfolio, Blog, About and contact. The home page operates the heart of all these pages that reflect at different sections.

The website is concentrated on presenting and describing different pages about Ayda, it is important that users can easily move between pages (so there is nav at the top above the fold and at the bottom) These navigation patterns are ideal and know to many people.

## Layout
The website uses a header, two column layout in the main section and medium fat footer. The site is not responsive yet at this stage until we treat those topics then we will come back to it and make it responsive.

## color
To keep it simple and sexy (KISS), the website use a single primary color and three additional colors.
The color theme also have an extended pallette consisting of swatches for the primary color;
